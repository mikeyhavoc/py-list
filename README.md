A simple console list app in python.

## To Do's

- [x] continually prompt to _add items_ || view list.
- [x] be able to _ask_ for help -> to understand commands.

**NOTE** <br>
I got this idea and listing from a **Team Tree House** challenge.
But then did on my own mainly. Some parts might **be different** from the challenge
or how they _create_ the project.
